- -When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When collaborating with other users, when working away from home keyboard, etc.
- -Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Because it gives users more flexibility.
- -Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Fork will automatically set-up a repository from someone else’s repository, clone will ‘clone’ someone else repository on to your local machine and not to your gitHub automatically while a branch is a mechanism that works locally on your project whenever you make a logical change.
